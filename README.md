#  Employee Performance prediction using various machine learning models
## Data and Variables:
1. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 1017 entries.
2. The target variable is "employee productivity," which is likely a measure of how efficiently employees are performing their tasks.
3. Several independent variables are used to predict employee productivity, including "team name," "targeted productivity," "smv" (standard minute value), "wip" (work in progress), "over_time," "incentive," "idle_time," "idle_men," "no_of_style_change," "no_of_workers," "month," "quarters," "department_finishing," "weeks," and "days."

## Regression Models:
1. Multiple Linear Regression: This model attempts to establish a linear relationship between the target variable (employee productivity) and multiple independent variables. It's a basic and interpretable regression technique.
2. Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that models nonlinear relationships by introducing polynomial terms of the independent variables.
3. Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR is a regression technique that uses support vector machines to find the best-fit line while allowing for a margin of error.
4. Decision Tree Regression: Decision trees split the dataset into subsets based on the values of independent variables and create a tree-like structure to make predictions.
5. Random Forest Regression: Random forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Model Evaluation:
1. The project evaluates the performance of these regression models using accuracy as the metric. However, it's important to note that accuracy is typically used for classification problems, not regression. In regression, metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared (R2) are more appropriate for assessing model performance.
2. The statement suggests that the Random Forest Regression model achieved the highest "accuracy" of nearly 40%, followed by Multiple Linear Regression at 28%, and Support Vector Regression at 27%.
3. It also mentions that Polynomial Regression and Decision Tree Regression did not perform well on the dataset.

## Interpretation:
1. The accuracy percentages provided are somewhat unusual for regression models. Accuracy is typically a classification metric and is not directly applicable to regression tasks.
2. It's essential to use appropriate evaluation metrics for regression models to gauge their predictive performance accurately.
3. The accuracy percentages may indicate that the Random Forest model had the smallest prediction errors (e.g., MSE or MAE) among the models tested. However, without these specific metrics, it's challenging to draw meaningful conclusions about the model's performance.
4. To improve this analysis, you should consider using regression-specific evaluation metrics, such as MAE or R2, to provide a more accurate assessment of how well each model predicts employee productivity. Additionally, feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model tuning could help enhance model performance.
